I have a need to share how much I love [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). It was a tool that was a significant part of my academic journey and I had fallen in love while I was writing my B.Sc. thesis[^1], and all coexisting add-ons were indirectly responsible for about 50 references mentioned. I've recently also incorporated Zotero into my workflow alongside another side-project on Notion.

Other remarkable features that Zotero offers:

- Awesome notes on existing PDFs. A bit better than [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)[^3] what was my main driver in B.Sc. era for taking notes from PDFs.[^4]
- Collection mechanism - it's a bit specific approach for zotero and needs time to be used to.
- Group collections that you can share your findings in teams.[^5]

What add-ons were helpful?

## Firefox extension

[Zotero Connector for Firefox](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors) simplifies the process of adding new database entries. A single click can trigger metadata extraction, and in some cases, even full-text PDF retrieval.[^2]

## Better Bibtex

[Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) allows exporting yours database in format compatible with Latex.

### Only Latex?

If you need a place to take notes and mention/link your entries, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) might be a good place to start. There is a great tutorial that was a great inspiration, available [here](vhttps://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-56bf918d51ab).

There is a newer approach, however, that might work a bit better - [Obsidian Zotero Plugin](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotero). Haven't tested yet.

## But what if I want to share my zotero-based entries with friends?

Sometime tool just doesn't suit well, and forcing others to use obsidian might be imposing useless cognitive overload, so then Notion comes into play with [notero](https://github.com/dvanoni/notero) extension. Works surprisingly smooth.

To wrap up, there are more efficient workflows than relying solely on a Word database or gathering references in a single designated file. And they may be integrated with your favorite applications

[^1]: That's the one tag which supposedly is a river and doesn't match to other apps listed.
[^2]: I was thinking if there may be an extension using other, less legal sources. Yep, they exist.
[^3]: Zotero has much more colors to highlight text.
[^4]: While PDF support in Zotero is superior, I was mainly taking notes from websites where hypothesis were better. Look in further sources section for great review of note-taking tools.
[^5]: Sharing is caring, or something like that.
