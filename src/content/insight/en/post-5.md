One of trends[^1] that captured my interest is [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification). This time I would like to highlight one famous example, named _Flexbox froggy_(link above), which uses this approach in explaining what [flexboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) are.

Fun, simple and rewarding, worth giving a try if you are by accident writing/styling a site or interested in game design.

[^1]: Pun intended. More info soon will be available in personal notes.
