Let's summarize what I'm using in my daily work.



# Blogging



After a bit long while with Ghost hosted on [mikrus](https://mikr.us/) I decided that my needs evolved enough, that:

- I need a place where I can post short notes that might be helpful to someone.(_Yes, this is description of the FAQ section_)
- Native multi-lingual posts. Just a whim.
- Strong separation between tech and non-tech posts.
- Independence of domain payments. ([one of the reasons why I'm interested]({{<relref path="about/_index.md#stroke">}}))



For the day of writing - i ended up with Hugo - due to the Go language - and great theme named meme.
